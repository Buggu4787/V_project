Vechicle Number Plate and Registration Number Detection
In 2020, Inrix, a traffic analytics company, conducted annual research analyzing traffic congestion in 1,000 cities across 50 countries. The study examined both the root causes and the impacts of traffic congestion on human life. At the top of the global list, Bogota, Colombia, was identified as the most congested city, followed by Bucharest, New York, Moscow, and Philadelphia. These cities experienced heavy traffic primarily due to their large populations and intense mobility during rush hours, despite the availability of various public transportation options provided by their governments.

In today’s urban environments, vehicles have become a basic necessity, enabling people to travel long distances in a short amount of time. However, the number of roads available in a city often fails to keep up with the growing number of vehicles, leading to frequent and severe traffic jams. In response, some local governments have introduced policies like the odd-even license plate regulation, as seen in Jakarta, Indonesia. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of such policies is limited due to the shortage of law enforcement personnel, making consistent implementation a challenge.

With advancements in modern technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is potential to overcome human limitations and enhance daily operations. AI, when properly trained, can analyze vast numbers of variables and predict the best outcomes. One specific application of AI is Computer Vision, which enables machines to recognize objects from images or video inputs. This technology is already widely adopted in various industries for object recognition tasks
.
In this context, researchers are focusing on developing an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that can categorize vehicles based on their license plates. This system leverages Computer Vision, particularly Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to accurately read the letters and numbers on a vehicle’s license plate. A significant challenge in this process is correctly identifying and locating the license plate within an image before applying OCR. If the license plate is not accurately located, the OCR reading may be inaccurate. Once the license plate information is successfully extracted, the system determines whether the vehicle falls into the odd or even category based on the last digit of the plate number.
